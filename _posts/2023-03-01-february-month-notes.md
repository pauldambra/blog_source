Year Goals for 2023

- continue becoming a better engineer and team-mate
- practice Italian every day
- train at the gym at least twice a week every week
- 8 leisurely cycle rides
- visit Italy at least twice

How did February go?

<!--more-->

In reverse order

## Visit Italy at least twice

I'm still figuring out when Italy #2 will be. I'd love to take daughter #1 to Sicily and then catch the train back up through the country. I can work, she can study, and we can both enjoy the food and culture. Maybe a pipe-dream...

## 8 leisurely cycle rides

0 cycle rides in Feb.

Lots of parenting and responsibilities this month, so very little time for myself. And the bags under my eyes are proof of that ðŸ™ˆ

## train at the gym at least twice a week

We were away in Cornwall for half term and so I managed 3 times a week while I was at home. And 2 times a week the 2 weeks that the trip overlapped with. But the dog and I went for a long run while in Cornwall and I accidentally went for a very long walk there. Turns out South West and South East are not the same direction ðŸ¤£

Here I am just after turning around, trying to figure out how to get back on track. At this point in time I thought I was all the way on the right-hand edge of that map segment ðŸ˜…

I don't ache everywhere all the time anymore. And, actually, feel pretty good. Plus time at the gym is uninterrupted pod-cast time. So, I'm happy with that.

## Practice Italian every day

âœ… only a few minutes at a time, but I did it every day.

## Continue becoming a better engineer and team-mate

I've been concentrating on this more this month. We joke a lot about being a group of lone wolves and in sprint planning I was described as "wolfing with everyone". I guess that's a good thing ðŸ˜…

My GCSE physics teacher told us to always start solving a problem with a diagram. This month's work was tricky, slow, and frustrating. But when I took the time to draw a diagram or two, and then go for an accidentally long walk, my brain was prepared, and my subconscious figured out how to make the complicated thing much, much less complicated.

One of my favourite engineering aphorisms is from Kent Beck: ["for each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change"](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032).

This particular piece of work, I had three attempts at that had to be abandoned because of side-effects to the change. By the time I'd simplified it, it was a less than 1-day change. [Here's an example of one of the pieces of simplication https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/14348](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/14348).
