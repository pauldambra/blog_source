How did March go?

<!--more-->

In reverse order

## Visit Italy at least twice

Excitement building this month because "Italy Trip Number One" is in April...

## 8 leisurely cycle rides

0 cycle rides in Mar.

## train at the gym at least twice a week

✅ Three times a week even while in the Caribbean with work. Still enjoying it.

## Practice Italian every day

✅ only a few minutes at a time, but I did it every day.

## Continue becoming a better engineer and team-mate

This was my last month on [team product analytics](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/product-analytics). I'm moving to [team session replay](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/session-recording). Ben and I built network performance monitoring in December and had a great work vibe - exciting to be building more monitoring tools.

It makes sense to move teams now because there's a natural gap... 1 week in Aruba with work, and then 2 weeks in Italy. So, I can start fresh when I get back.

### Yep, that's right - Aruba

We had our annual offsite in Aruba this month. It was a ridiculously beautiful place.

The highlight is always [the hackathon](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/offsites#all-company-offsite-hackathon). This year I worked on a team building issue tracking into PostHog.

Hackathon always reminds me of how powerful it is to start work together and excited.

My new favourite planning method is "post-it notes on a table with food and drink".
