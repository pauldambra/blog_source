This post is part of a series where I'm hoping to prove to myself that building a dynamic website with NodeJS is much more fun than using a CMS platform. [See the first post for an explanation of why](/2014/02/websites-cms.html)

The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pauldambra/omniclopse)

 > A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. 

 The basic idea is that you can swap in a promise where you would normally pass in a callback. 

 The primary interaction is that you call a method which returns a promise which will eventually return a result (it *can* immediately return the result if it's available) and you chain a call to `.then()` onto that method call.

 The call to then is equivalent to passing in the callback function.

 Clear as mud?

There's (much) more at the [Promises specification website](http://promisesaplus.com/). 

# Bluebird
This is JavaScript so there are a bazillion npm packages that could be used to switch the project's code to using promises. A (relatively small) bit of <del>googling</del> research suggested that the [Bluebird](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bluebird) library was a good bet. 

In their words:

 > Bluebird is a fully featured promise library with focus on innovative features and performance

# Before
Here's the code from the [previous Post](/websites-CMS-platform-logging-in.html) which shows the smelly, [arrow anti-pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ArrowAntiPattern)

```js 
var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
var SALT_WORK_FACTOR = 10;

module.exports = function(db) {
  return {
    create: function(username, password, callback) {
        bcrypt.genSalt(SALT_WORK_FACTOR, function(err, salt) {
            if (err) {
                callback(err);
                return;
            }
            bcrypt.hash(password, salt, function(err, hash) {
                if (err) {
                    callback(err);
                    return;
                }
                db.users.save({
                    username:username,
                    password:hash
                }, function(err, result) {
                    if(err) {
                        callback(err.err);
                    } else {
                        callback('user created');
                    }
                });
            });
        });
    }
  };
};
```

This took a bit of faff to translate to promises almost entirely as a result of this being the first ever promises code I've written and I didn't RTFM.

I did have this code covered by tests so I could leave mocha running in the background and poke the code with a stick (Yay TDD!)

# After
The first pass at implementing promises generated:

```js 
var SALT_WORK_FACTOR = 10;

var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
var Promise = require('bluebird');

var genSalt = Promise.promisify(bcrypt.genSalt);
var genHash = Promise.promisify(bcrypt.hash);

module.exports = function(db) {
    var users = Promise.promisifyAll(db.users);

  return {
    create: function(username, password, callback) {
        genSalt(SALT_WORK_FACTOR).then(function(salt) {
	        return genHash(password, salt);
	    }).then(function(hash) {
            return users.saveAsync({
                    username:username,
                    password:hash
            });
        }).then(function() {
            callback('user created');
        }).error(function (e) {
            callback(e.message);
        });
    }
  };
};
```

All tests still pass at this point and there's fewer levels of arrow to wade through but it still feels a bit pointy and not massively clear so...

```js 
var SALT_WORK_FACTOR = 10;

var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
var Promise = require('bluebird');

var genSalt = Promise.promisify(bcrypt.genSalt);
var genHash = Promise.promisify(bcrypt.hash);

module.exports = function(db) {
    var users = Promise.promisifyAll(db.users);

  return {
    create: function(username, password, callback) {
        var hashPassword = function() {
            return genSalt(SALT_WORK_FACTOR).then(function(salt) {
                return genHash(password, salt);
            });
        };

        var persistUser = function(hashedPassword) {
            return users.saveAsync({
                    username:username,
                    password:hashedPassword
            });
        };

        hashPassword()
        .then(persistUser)
        .then(function() {
            callback('user created');
        }).error(function (e) {
            callback(e.message);
        });
    }
  };
};
```

skipping over the setup code you can get to the meat of the module

```js 
hashPassword()
.then(persistUser)
.then(function() {
    callback('user created');
}).error(function (e) {
    callback(e.message);
});
```

Which is a huge amount clearer than the starting point! I do like a method to be a sentence! 'Hash password then persist user'!

A very high count of exclamation marks in this post but that was much easier and more fun than I anticipated - winner!

At this point I either need to pass through the code to implement promises more widely... or I could choose to leave everything as it is and improve each code file as it's touched.

As it is it's nearly midnight and my alarm goes off at 5:50am so...
