I've got [a mini 5101](https://support.hp.com/gb-en/document/c01846437). A little HP netbook that I lurve. It runs Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 with aplomb.

<!--more-->

My one gripe is that (much like my mac keyboard) the Function key functions are the main action of that key... so in Windows if you hit F5 to refresh a web page the laptop actually sleeps.

If you hit F3 to search in chrome instead you dim the screen. Annoying, no?

So I travel the dusty highways to the BIOS settings and there's an option to switch the function, erm, function. Some BIOS' refer to this as switching "media keys". I switch this to enable, boot up and my function keys are my own again.

All is well...
           ...
           ...
           ...

except...
<!--alex ignore rejects-->
If you let the laptop sleep then when it wakes up it prompts for a password which it rejects as incorrect. Now I typed my password * V * E * R * Y * carefully but no joy.

I discovered if I hit switch user and chose the same user then the log in screen displayed the user status as "logged in" instead of "locked". Type the same password here and I can log in... What the what!?

I didn't immediately connect these changes... in my defence this isn't my main machine and I only use it sporadically.

I created a new user... no change.

Then I reinstalled Windows... no change.

I jumped into Google feet first and found almost nothing. Lots of forum posts where nothing is discovered and everyone has a slightly different problem which they describe vaguely. In my experience this generally points to a problem between the chair and the keyboard and so I sat and thought until I had tied the two together in my head.

As a test I let the laptop sleep, checked it rejected my password and then I held down the function key and typed the password. Voila I could log in.

Now I have to decide which behaviour is most annoying
