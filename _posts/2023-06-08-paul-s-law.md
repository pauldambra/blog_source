Everyone should have their own law... This is mine:

# All new build tools are better than what came before. Until they are able to solve all of the problems of the thing they replaced and then they're at least as bad. A new tool will then replace them

<!--more-->

Anyone who remembers the mad rush to replace every build tool in your JavaScript projects with Grunt, to have to replace that with Gulp only days later, will know what I mean.
