Over the last two days I've been researching using Windows Deployment Services with BDD. I've got 4 workstations to build so I may as well investigate it right?

<!--more-->

I am also updating my main machine from build 7100 of Win 7 Ultimate to the RTM so I have a Win XP box on my desk that I've built to give me continuity and a new Win 7 install.

Both of which had Bing as the default search engine out of the box.

So I thought I'd run with it. After all I'm searching for Microsoft technologies...

The first hit from the string "BDD 2007 download" in Google is:

`http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=02A2605D-51E8-469F-BE4A-1DD2AF580502&displaylang=en`

That used to be the download page for BDD 2007 on Microsoft's site.

The first hit from the same string on Bing.com is:

`http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/desktopdeployment/default.aspx`

That's not the BDD 2007 page and I can't even see a BDD link on there.

Bad, bad, bad and bad. I think that's a reasonable search string when I want to download BDD 2007 and so does google whereas Bing seems to think I want to hit some generic front end and read lots of whitepapers... 

That's why I think of Google as a productivity tool.
