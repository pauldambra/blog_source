It turns out that Neapolitan pizza dough is a strictly described thing. The [UK version of the EU rules are here](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2010/97/annexes). Those instructions use 1.8 kilograms of flour and 1 litre of water. But (if you're not going to a wholesaler) flour comes in 1 kilogram bags. Ingredients have been adjusted to 1kg for this recipe.

I sometimes use a biga starter. [Instructions for that are here](https://pauldambra.dev/biga-calculator/). But it takes more work, time, and nuance. 

This recipe can be completed in a single day and makes a very consistently tasty dough

(Yes! _That_ much salt)
