* keep being kind to yourselves and each other
* keep being bold but stay humble
* people and interactions over processes and tools (that's one of the best bits of the agiles)
* keep releasing small things
    * then try and release smaller
* slow down, start less, and you'll finish more
* ask three questions
    1. why should I start this work
    2. how will I know when to stop
    3. how will I know if it is still working tomorrow
* make the loosely coupled version of the service or system
* make the simpler version of the service or system
* delete things
* help everyone take part in service and support
* help everyone take part in design and user research
* keep being amazing
* as long as you are being kind to yourself, you are allowed to hold yourself to a higher standard (but be kind first!)
* Nolite te Bastardes Carborundorum
