There are a few memes (in the original sense) that have got stuck in my head. They feel like the beginning of madness. I'm going to track them, to see how many I accumulate

* water isn't real
* old people are time travellers

Each of them feels like something that would tip a different me over the edge into madness.

# Water isn't real

I could be easily convinced that water isn't real.

Sit in a boat, look over the edge at the water.

It's obviously CGI. Can't possibly be real.

# Old people are time travellers

Whenever I've had a baby (a common thing I've done) I'll be walking with the baby in the pram, and very sleep deprived.

An old person passing by will say something like: "Oh, what a lovely baby". Some similar nice thing to that.

In my sleep deprived state it once occurred to me that a very lucrative business - if time travel existed - would be to let you travel back and see your grandparent as a baby.

Can't get that out of my head now. Whenever an old person is nice to me, i'm a little odd with them... because at the back of my mind there's a voice saying "that's exactly what a time traveller would say".
