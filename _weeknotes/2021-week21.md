## 2021 Week 21

🛹 onboarded 10 new team members from Zuhlke this week <br/>
🤷 it went surprisingly smoothly <br/>
💖 so much effort and kindness from everyone to make it work<br/>
🎹 no time writing code this week so, I ended the week test driving a state machine <br/>
🗺 took part in more Wardley mapping <br/>
🙌 attended a diversity and inclusion session <br/>
🎓 the work that some of the senior leaders have put in to learn about D&I shines through in how they talk <br/>
😍 promised Chris L that I'd include they said nice things, cos they did, and it always helps to get feedback
✅ had fun (despite the odds)
