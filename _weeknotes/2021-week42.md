## 2021 Week 42

📅 week five in the new job, so a month however you cut it <br/>
🚀 I'd forgotten how much fun the dopamine fix of deep work on a feature was <br/>
🗣 10.5 hours of meetings over two weeks, I think in the last job I would have that much in one day <br/>
🤯 asked the team I'm on if it was OK to take a day off -> "don't need to ask, only inform" #Trust <br/>
🏢 spent a day at the Manchester WeWork <br/> 
☕️ on-site barista in the morning <br/>
🍕 had lunch with old colleagues <br/>
🏃‍♀️ I'm forgetting to do exercise more and more as the weather gets worse <br/>
🕰 lack of a commute means I tend to forget to write these <br/>
✅ had fun <br/>
