## 2021 Week 23

⌨️ spent quite a bit of time (helping) writing code this week<br/>
🔁 some code to automate browser performance testing<br/>
😰 lots of time swearing at YAML and waiting for lambda@edge's slow feedback cycle<br/>
💖 bits of time meeting different people to try and understand them better<br/>
😱 some time staring into the middle distance in frustration<br/>
🤗 some opportunities to give feedback<br/>
✅ had fun (intermittently)
