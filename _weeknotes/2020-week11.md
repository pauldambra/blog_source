## 2020 Week 11

🌪 felt like I was running around spinning plates this week <br/>
💖 love that someone noticed and reminded me to talk and let people help <br/>
🔭 worked remote two days. It was ok but strange to start something new on a background of anxiety <br/>
🧭 feeling disconnected from the why of some things <br/>
😍 new colleague joined us and has got stuck in right away <br/>
👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 had our Friday show and tell remotely. Which worked well but was a bit weird <br/>
🦄 discovered that two things I've been worrying about are practically finished <br/>
✅ had fun
