## 2021 Week 26

ğŸ˜¥ long week <br/>
ğŸŒ“ how are we half-way through the year <br/>
ğŸ’‰ started with second COVID jab <br/>
ğŸ’– got some awesome, timely support this week <br/>
ğŸ˜¬ for some scary meetings <br/>
ğŸ˜… which weren't as scary as I worried <br/>
ğŸ˜˜ some awesome colleagues move off the team this week <br/>
ğŸ‘‹ and another left entirely <br/>
ğŸ‘» managed to completely break a project with an innocuous change - haunted NPM packages at fault<br/>
âœ… had fun <br/>
