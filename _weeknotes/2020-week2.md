## 2020 Week 2

😫 this week was full on!<br/>
🎩 had to change hats so often - people management, presenting, refactoring, coaching, architecting, and more. <br/>
🛏️ I'm frazzled<br/>
🦸‍♀️ lots of folk dealing with frustrating circumstances this week<br/>
💖 wonderful to see people pull together<br/>
💻 spent most of a day with the mob working on offers<br/>
🗣️ banged on about pipes and filters<br/>
💎 automated weeknotes out of my blog with some ruby<br/>
✅ had fun
