## 2020 Week 6

☯️ saw the best and worst sides of being at a big company this week<br/>
🗺 saw people hear the word "plan" and assume it means a loss of autonomy<br/>
Ⓡ agile still has requirements<br/>
💡 it just doesn't pretend it can get them all right on day one<br/>
| agile still has deadlines<br/>
🔭 but it plays with scope to meet them<br/>
🚀 lots of same day fixes again this week<br/>
✅ had fun
