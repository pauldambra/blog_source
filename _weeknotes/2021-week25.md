## 2021 Week 25

🤔 odd week, only three days in work<br/>
🤷‍♀️ started with bittersweet news at home <br/>
🦷 ended with one of the kids having dental work under general anaesthetic<br/>
⌨️ only wrote code for fun this week<br/>
🤯 can't get my head around some things at work <br/>
💖 principles and empathy is the name of the game<br/>
😭 some folk who have been doing great work are moving off the team<br/>
🙌 zuhlke folk that have joined us are starting to build a head of steam <br/>
~ fun at points <br/>
