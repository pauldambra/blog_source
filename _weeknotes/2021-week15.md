## 2021 Week 15

🎢 this 5 day week has felt 2 days long - wat<br/>
🗣 aimed to spend 10 hours with engineers doing the typey-typey <br/>
👍 managed 6 hours <br/>
😍 it is a balm for the soul <br/>
🏃‍♂️ some of what is happening is really hard and draining <br/>
👩‍❤️‍👨 but somehow this week still felt good for more time than not <br/>
💖 seeing folk working to improve and be kind recharges me <br />
✅ had fun
