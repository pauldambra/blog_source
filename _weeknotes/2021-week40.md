## 2021 Week 40

🎬 week three in new job <br/>
🤔 practiced honesty in 1-2-1, meant I got supported *and* challenged, good result <br/>
🧠 still slower than I'd like to be, but learning <br/>
🔢 used property based testing to try to solve a problem <br/>
🤯 asked for the rule around some spending -> "just do what you think is in company's best interest" #Trust <br/>
💖 had nice feedback <br/>
👨‍🦲 got a new webcam because old one was too low resolution. Can now see how bald I am :'( <br/>
✅ had fun <br/>
