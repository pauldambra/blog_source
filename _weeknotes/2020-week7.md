## 2020 Week 6

🌪this week was wild <br/>
🏃‍♂️ it was non-stop <br/>
💰every meeting feels different now we've been told how much money we have to make for each pound we spend <br/>
🗣lots of honesty this week and remembering that talking has been our super power <br/>
⛈including talking about EventStorming at xpmanchester<br/>
💤so draining but was fun too<br/>
💖we challenged each other to give feedback more. I gave feedback every day. It's hard<br/>
✅ had fun
