## 2020 Week 5

💖 2 big incredible things this week<br/>
💪 we're trialling locking your account when you log in if you have a known compromised (pwned) password<br/>
🔐 we turned on the AWS WAF in front of a subset of our systems<br/>
🚀 both things have been a labour of love<br/>
🗣 lots of meetings but still feel like I've spent time with the team<br/>
❓ wish I knew how so I could do that more<br/>
✅ had fun
