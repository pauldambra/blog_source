## 2021 Week 6

👎 managed to hold only a single hour for coding <br/>
🤯 everything still feels new so I asked lots of questions <br/>
🙌 I felt like I was slowing people down but the mob were welcoming <br />
👍 again meeting time was focussed on ongoing work <br />
🌪 but there's so much going on <br/>
🤔 and I'm terrible at prioritising <br />
🏃‍♂️ I'm biased towards action <br/>
☸️ so all the planning isn't my wheelhouse <br />
✅ had fun
