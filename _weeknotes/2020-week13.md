## 2020 Week 13

🎥 a week of being frustrated and learning how (not?) to do video calls <br/>
💖 still incredible to see everyone supporting each other <br/>
🔭 it's lovely to be surrounded by family all the time but... <br/>
❓ what am I supposed to do - turns out my job was looking for serendipitous conversations... <br/>
🧭 and helping nudge things in the right direction or help give people courage to try something <br/>
🏚 that's not going to work now so I need to find a better way to contribute <br/>
🚀 fascinating to see this normally slow company try to act at furious pace <br/>
👩‍⚕️ important to figure out how to keep some of this new bold pace once we're past the pandemic <br/>
✅ had fun
