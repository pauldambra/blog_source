## 2021 Week 13

🌪 WHAT A WEEK, BLIMEY <br/>
🏃‍♂️ has been incredible to see people working together<br/>
💔 has been sad to see people leaving<br/>
👎 out of eleven hours put to one side I managed one hour with engineers<br/>
😱 attended the worst run meeting there has ever been<br/>
🗣 talking, being open, being honest, that's all there really is<br/>
✅ had fun
