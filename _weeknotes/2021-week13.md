## 2021 Week 13

🌪 WHAT A WEEK, BLIMEY
🏃‍♂️ has been incredible to see people working together
💔 has been sad to see people leaving
👎 out of eleven hours put to one side I managed one hour with engineers
😱 attended the worst run meeting there has ever been
🗣 talking, being open, being honest, that's all there really is
✅ had fun
