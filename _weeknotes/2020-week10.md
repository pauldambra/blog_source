## 2020 Week 10

💖 multiple instances of being supported or seeing people be supported this week <br/>
🌪 basically 50% of my time this week was meetings <br/>
🏚 and most of the rest of the time trying to catch up ad-hoc on actual work <br/>
⌨️ paired once, demoed TDD once and... <br/>
🙈 spent an hour confused before I caught up and realised people had given me the answer and needed help implementing it <br/>
🎛 remote pairing/mobbing is hard. I wasn't good at it <br/>
😕 we had an API design session. I felt really confused and unprepared <br />
🎯 realised afterwards I've had a really clear direction for 18 months and the teams have overtaken me <br />
🤔 I'll have to do more thinking _and_ get everyone else to own the design more <br/>
🔨 went back and refactored something this morning cause I couldn't live with myself if I'd left it <br/>
✅ had fun
