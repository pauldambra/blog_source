I"Ç<p>It is relatively common to find (or write) a line of code like this</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	<span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">thingy</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Thingy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_someDependency</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Reading this line a person can know this is initialising a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thingy</code> which takes a dependency on somethingâ€¦ and something else is false.

I'm really lazy and easily distracted so I don't like to have to think about anything except the one task I'm trying to not get distracted from. Having to think about what it means that something is false provides an opportunity for me to get distracted.</p>
