<p>🚀 got concentrated time coding with others this week <br />
💖 someone mentioned about being scared of a bit of code, so we fixed it <br />
🗣 privileged that I'm able to choose not to go to meetings to make that time to code <br />
🔐 facilitated some threat modelling <br />
🙌 lucky to have awesome colleagues to crib from <br />
🤯 it's been a hard a week, someone said something nice in an email, I nearly cried <br />
🤗 make sure you're saying nice things to people when you think them, they might really need it <br />
✅ had fun</p>
