<p>😭 another rollercoaster week <br />
💖 received nice feedback, that got me through the week <br />
❌ almost didn't get to spend any time with the engineers <br />
👀 the time I did get was because of a heisenbug in production <br />
🤩 new starter from a new partner - if the others are even half as good we're in a great place <br />
🌗 thought that I'd achieved something I'd been heading at for weeks <br />
👎 but no (not yet!) <br />
✅ had fun (barely, thanks to awesome team)</p>
