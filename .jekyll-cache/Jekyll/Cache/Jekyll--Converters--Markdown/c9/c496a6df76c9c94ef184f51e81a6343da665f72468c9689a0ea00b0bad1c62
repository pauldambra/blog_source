<p>🌪this week was wild <br />
🏃‍♂️ it was non-stop <br />
💰every meeting feels different now we've been told how much money we have to make for each pound we spend <br />
🗣lots of honesty this week and remembering that talking has been our super power <br />
⛈including talking about EventStorming at xpmanchester<br />
💤so draining but was fun too<br />
💖we challenged each other to give feedback more. I gave feedback every day. It's hard<br />
✅ had fun</p>
