I"~<p>Since <a href="https://twitter.com/pauldambra/status/916336773566992384">October 2017</a> I've been keeping week notes. I've found them a fantastic tool to track my focus and to remember to reflect on success (or lack of it).</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://medium.com/@nathan_nowinhd/year-note-b389d092b8fe">colleagues</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tekin/status/1213878853560651776">some</a> <a href="https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/yearnotes-2019">tooters</a> have written year notes as 2019 ends. And here are mine… It feels egotistical… but hopefully it's useful to me in the future even if it isn't to anyone else.</p>
