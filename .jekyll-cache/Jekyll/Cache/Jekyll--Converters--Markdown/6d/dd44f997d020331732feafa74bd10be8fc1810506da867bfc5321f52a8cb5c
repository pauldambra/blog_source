<p>Twice recently I've hit the same problem with two different mobile phone vendor's websites. Vodafone (displayed here) and 3. When I type a phone number I split it into three sections using white-space. "nnnn nnn nnnn" that's how I remember numbers. That's not uncommon I don't thinkâ€¦</p>

<p>nor is it odd to use a dash.</p>

<p>So why do I need to learn how your website wants phone numbers formatted.</p>

<p>Whack some javascript on your pageâ€¦ you <em>must</em> be using it for something!</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var correctedNumber = numberTypedOnForm.replace(" ","").replace("-","");</code></p>

<p>and with that massive development cost you aren't going to make someone type a number twice only to satisfy your database server. Yes, not everyone will have javascript turned on and it won't catch everyone's weird way of typing phone numbers</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"(nnnn)-nn-nn-nn-n"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but it's about not introducing a pain point for customers when you don't have to</p>

<p>If you want to be really fancy you could</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var correctedNumber = numberTypedOnForm.replace("/\D/g","");</code></p>

<p>Computers are supposed to make our lives easier but it's up to <em>you</em> website developers to help them help us.</p>
