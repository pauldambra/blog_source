I"W<p>At the end of the last post I realised I'd sacrificed some good practice in the rush to make it work (i.e. worked normally like all those other guilty software engineers everywhere everyday.)
<!--alex ignore kids --->
So earlier today I played with the kids to tire them out enough that I could distract them with television and write some #holidaycode because I am a good(-ish) parent.</p>

<p>I managed to</p>

<ul>
  <li>switch from using magic strings in the messagebus channel and topic identifiers</li>
  <li>remove some duplication</li>
  <li>and get some tests around ReactJS</li>
</ul>
