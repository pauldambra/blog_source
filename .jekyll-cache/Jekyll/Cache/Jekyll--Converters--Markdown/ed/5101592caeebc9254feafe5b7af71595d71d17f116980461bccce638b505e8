<p><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/learn/overview/">AMP or Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> is a Google-backed project that allows you to use restricted HTML to delivery static content quickly. Since AMP HTML is restricted it isn't a fit for every site.</p>

<p>Since this blog is published as static HTML articles it is a good candidate for publishing an AMP version. An open source AMP jekyll plugin was amended to add AMP versions of pages.</p>

<p>The major discovery was that the validation tooling around AMP is awesome. Compare that to Facebook Instant Articles where there is almost no validation tooling (that I could discover at least)â€¦</p>

<p>This didn't feel like a topic that justified several posts so to avoid taking too long this is a bit of a whistle-stop tour of adding AMP pages to this blog.</p>
