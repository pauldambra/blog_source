I"Ê	<p>So I'm building a page in a mobile app to find "things".</p>

<p>Some assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you're using the app you are already familiar with the "things"</li>
  <li>You've clicked "Find Things" and so you're expecting, as a minimum, to type something into a box (to tell the app what things you want to find)</li>
  <li>You're a busy person and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">you don't want to have to think</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each thing has a name and a location. The one is, to some extent, meaningless without the other. What I want is that if you enter a name or a part of a name then you get a list of things whose names match. If you enter a place then you get a list of things sorted by distance from that place.</p>

<p>I'd like the search function to be as unobtrusive as possible and to my mind that means that the user shouldn't have to tell me whether they've entered a name or a place.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that sometimes the name of the thing <em>is</em> the name of a place. When you type in that text expecting to search in the context of it being a place I currently have no way of letting you override the context of it being the name of a "thing".</p>

<p>The question is do I catch only that scenario - as in this first set of mockupsâ€¦</p>

<p>I like this because the intention is pretty clear and the UI doesn't contain elements to muddy the intention unless we're already in a situation where we might need to make additional decisions.</p>

<p>But if there's a use-case or an incorrect result state that we haven't accounted for the user could find themselves stuck - I can't think of it but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.</p>

<p>So we could add a toggle that allows people to tell us what they want to do - as in this setâ€¦</p>

<p>I worry that there's more to parse on this screen but also I wonder if it makes the fact that you can search by address more discoverable.</p>

<p>Or something else or <a href="http://cdn.crushable.com/files/2012/05/whatthewhat.gif" target="_blank">what-the-what</a> and thenâ€¦. oh no! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">ANALYSIS PARALYSIS</a>!!!111!!!1!!!</p>
