I"0<p>Disclaimer: I use and love an iPad (1). I've got an iPhone, mac mini, a MBP and an iMac. But I'm not an out and out fanboy - I'm a windows admin and nascent C# developer. I try to use Linux where it fits and find more places it fits all the time. And I've been developing an Android application.</p>

<p>TL;DR The transformer prime is a beautiful computer but it might be true there's an iPad market and not a tablet market.</p>

<h2 id="update">UPDATE</h2>

<p>And then today Google release Chrome for Ice Cream Sandwich. BEST. TABLET. BROWSER. EVAR.</p>
