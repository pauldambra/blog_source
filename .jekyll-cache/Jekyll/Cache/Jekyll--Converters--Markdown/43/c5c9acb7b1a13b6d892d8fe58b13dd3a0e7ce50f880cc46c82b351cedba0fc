<p>For our team's most recent retro we decided to try a new format to see how it affected our discussion. We thought we'd share it here in case it has value for other teams.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>A retrospective is a practice from <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?IterationRetrospective">XP described on the c2.wiki</a> as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A practice which has an XP team asking itself, at the end of each iteration : What went well ? 
What could be improved ? 
What could we experiment with ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We've recently had several discussions trying to focus on the real and perceived progress of our work and thought it would be beneficial to run the retro with a focus on the impact of our team's principles and practices. Specifically how they relate to delivery of value and speed of delivery.</p>
