I"å<p>So I'm building a page in a mobile app to find "things".</p>

<p>Some assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you're using the app you are already familiar with the "things"</li>
  <li>You've clicked "Find Things" and so you're expecting, as a minimum, to type something into a box (to tell the app what things you want to find)</li>
  <li>You're a busy person and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">you don't want to have to think</a></li>
</ul>
