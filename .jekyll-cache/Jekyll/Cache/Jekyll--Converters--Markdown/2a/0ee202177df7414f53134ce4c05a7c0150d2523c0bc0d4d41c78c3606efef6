I"/<p>During <a href="http://agilemanchester.net/2017/sessions/index.php?session=200">Kevin Rutherford's guided discussion on clean code at Agile Manchester 2017</a> we talked briefly about whether there was a difference between 'cleaning code' and 'clean code'.</p>

<p>I suggested that I might expect to have to make code dirtier on the road to making it cleaner. Being of the opinion that  sometimes you need to add duplication in order to see your way to removing it.</p>

<p>As I am a creature of bad habit I jumped immediately into tortuous metaphor.</p>
