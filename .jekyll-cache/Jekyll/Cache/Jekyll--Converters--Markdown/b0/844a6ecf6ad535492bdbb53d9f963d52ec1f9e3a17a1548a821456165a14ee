I"™<p>Since <a href="https://twitter.com/pauldambra/status/916336773566992384">October 2017</a> I've been keeping week notes. I've found them a fantastic tool to track my focus and to remember to reflect on success (or lack of it). I didn't write them for most of 2020. When pandemic hit it seemed too self-centered. I wish I'd kept them up now.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="/2020/01/year-notes.html">year notes last year</a>. Surprisingly that was the only blog post I wrote last year ðŸ˜±</p>

<p>Here are mine for 2020â€¦ It feels egotisticalâ€¦ but it's intended to remind me to reflect. Hopefully it's useful to me in the future even if it isn't to anyone else.</p>
