I"†<p>Over the last two days I've been researching using Windows Deployment Services with BDD. I've got 4 workstations to build so I may as well investigate it right?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I am also updating my main machine from build 7100 of Win 7 Ultimate to the RTM so I have a Win XP box on my desk that I've built to give me continuity and a new Win 7 install.</p>

<p>Both of which had Bing as the default search engine out of the box.</p>

<p>So I thought I'd run with it. After all I'm searching for Microsoft technologiesâ€¦</p>

<p>The first hit from the string "BDD 2007 download" in Google is:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=02A2605D-51E8-469F-BE4A-1DD2AF580502&amp;displaylang=en</code></p>

<p>That used to be the download page for BDD 2007 on Microsoft's site.</p>

<p>The first hit from the same string on Bing.com is:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/desktopdeployment/default.aspx</code></p>

<p>That's not the BDD 2007 page and I can't even see a BDD link on there.</p>

<p>Bad, bad, bad and bad. I think that's a reasonable search string when I want to download BDD 2007 and so does google whereas Bing seems to think I want to hit some generic front end and read lots of whitepapersâ€¦</p>

<p>That's why I think of Google as a productivity tool.</p>
