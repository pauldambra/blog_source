I'm interested in words that we all use and believe we understand. But that we hold differing definitions of. Words and phrases that make it harder to communicate because they're common and vary in meaning.

I spent most of my career without hearing the words *strategy* and *tactics*. Here I explain what I think they mean, and how I hear people use them. Hopefully, explaining how you can better communicate as a result.

I write this blog to learn, and I don't present myself as an expert on either strategy or tactics. If you disagree or think I don't go far enough, I'd love to hear from you [on twitter](https://twitter.com/pauldambra).

# Strategy

Recently at work I had to give the feedback that a document was titled a "data migration strategy" but didn't contain a strategy. At best it gave a list of things that would be done. It wasn't a strategy because it didn't tell me why those things would be done, why other things weren't. It didn't communicate what choices were being made to cope with the known and unknown

Strategy is ["is a general plan to achieve one or more long-term or overall goals under conditions of uncertainty."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy)
