I've been at Co-op for four years now. And, I'm currently 44 years old. Anyone that knows me, knows I'm incapable of turning down an idea expressed with alliteration. 

So, here's four things I've learned in the last four years at the age of forty four. Four from four at forty four.

That I have learned them doesn't mean that I have perfected them. I have learned I'll lose weight if I stop having seconds. Guess whether I still have seconds...

That I have learned them doesn't mean they are universally applicable. Problems only match their solutions in a context. What works for one team may not work for another. It might not even work for the same team if you change one person.

I set the rules that:

* it must be "a lesson I've learned" and not "an opinion I hold" 
* it must be constructive or at least not only be "here is a thing I did not like or did not value"

That meant I had to delete some lessons that turned out not to be lessons because they broke the rules. They were: 

* Agile is dead
* Minimise all planning and coordination

The four lessons are:

1. Tell people they are great
2. Write things down

## 1. Tell people they're great

In [1968, Rosenthal and Jacobsen](https://www.krigolsonteaching.com/uploads/4/3/8/4/43848243/teacher_impact_on_self_confidence.pdf) gave intelligence tests to children at an elementary school. They selected 20% of the students at random and told the teachers that the tests showed those children had "unusual potential for intellectual growth". Eight months later, those students scored significantly higher when retested (as compared with the other students). This has been [repeated outside of the classroom](https://hbr.org/2003/01/pygmalion-in-management) with similar effects.

So, you could think of it as a life hack. Tell people they'll be great, you hack the system, and performance goes up. Or you could see it as giving people the opportunity to perform by being clear about what good performance is.

Look at what people did and tell them why it was good. "I love how this team gets changes to production so fast". "It's awesome how we responded to that incident so calmly". "I love how you focussed back onto writing a test". 

People don't have to be doing perfectly for you to find something to congratulate. And, if you can't find a single good thing to share with them. Well, wouldn't you want to know that? And that you can improve it by setting high expectations?

If you keep raising expectations for people, [be aware that it costs them to meet those expectations.](http://panmore.com/pygmalion-effect-and-burnout-when-employees-are-pushed-too-hard). So, *also* set high expectations for self-care, for caring for each other. Keep that goal for self-care in tension with the goal for higher performance.
